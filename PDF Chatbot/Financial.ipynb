decision-making bodies. The main policy and decision-making bodies of WIPO are the General Assembly, the Conference and the Coordination Committee. The General Assembly consists of States party to the WIPO Convention which are members of any of the Unions administered by WIPO. The Conference is composed of the States party to the WIPO Convention, and is, inter alia, the competent body for adopting amendments to the Convention. The Coordination Committee consists of elected members of the Executive Committees of the Paris or the Berne Unions or both, one-fourth of the States party to the WIPO Convention which are not members of any of the Unions, and Switzerland, as the State on whose territory the Organization has its headquarters.\\n\\nThe financial statements of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) for the year to December 31, 2016, are submitted to the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO as required by Regulation 6.7 of the Financial Regulations and Rules (FRR). The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), as developed and approved by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB).\\n\\nThe report of the External Auditor on the audit of the 2016 financial statements, together with his opinion on the financial statements, are also submitted to the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO as prescribed under Regulation 8.11 and Annex II of the FRR.\\n\\nThe General Assembly appoints the WIPO Director General upon nomination by the Coordination Committee. The Director General is the chief executive of the Organization. The Director General is assisted by the Senior Management Team (consisting of the Deputy Directors General and the Assistant Directors General, plus the Legal Counsel and the Director of the Human Resources Management Department) in providing the strategic direction of WIPO’s programs and in managing their respective Sectors and Programs to ensure the delivery of results in line with the Organization’s strategic goals and the Program and Budget.\\n\\nThe annual financial report, including financial statement discussion and analysis, is presented in this document alongside the financial statements.\\n\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\n\\nThe following financial statement discussion and analysis includes an overview of the Organization’s operations and environment, financial objectives and strategies, risk management strategy, financial performance and financial position during the year to December 31, 2016. It has been prepared in accordance with IPSASB Recommended Practice Guideline 2, and is intended to provide an explanation of the significant items, transactions, and events presented in the financial statements and the factors that influenced them. This discussion and analysis is not part of WIPO’s financial statements; however, it should be read together with WIPO’s financial statements (pages 23 to 68).\\n\\nWIPO generates most of its revenue from fees which are paid by users of its intellectual property services for patents, trademarks and industrial designs. These services are provided through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), Madrid and Hague systems. In 2016, fees from these activities represented 91.6 per cent of the Organization’s total revenue, with PCT system fees alone representing 75.0 per cent. The driver for revenue from these fee-paid services is the international demand for intellectual property titles. This demand is influenced by the performance of the global economy, although since 2010 global intellectual property filing activity has continued to grow despite uneven economic recovery from the global financial crisis that began in 2008. Latest available statistics up to the end of 2015 show that worldwide patent and trademark applications have grown each year since 2010. Global patent applications rose to 2.89 million in 2015, representing a 7.8 per cent increase over 2014. An estimated 5.98\\n\\nWIPO is the global forum for intellectual property services, policy, information and cooperation. It is a specialized agency of the United Nations, with 189 Member States. The Organization’s mission is to lead the development of a balanced and effective international intellectual property system that enables innovation and creativity for the economic, social and cultural development of all countries. The\\n\\nmillion trademark applications were filed worldwide in 2015, 15.3 per cent more than in 2014. Global industrial design activity increased more modestly in 2015 (annual growth of 2.3 per cent in applications, and 0.6 per cent in the number of designs contained in applications), though this followed a decline in 2014.\\n\\nrevised in 2015. WIPO’s reserves are accounted for as the net assets of the Organization, and serve to minimize the impact of income shortfalls and maximize the probability that the Organization can meet its obligations in the short term and maintain financial stability. One core element of the policy is the mechanism for establishing the required level of reserves as a percentage of the estimated biennial expenditure of the Unions administered by the Organization. The policy also establishes the principles and approval mechanism for the use of reserves for one-time projects for capital improvements and exceptional circumstances.\\n\\nOther external factors which may influence the Organization’s revenue from its fee-paid services include research and development investment levels, technological confidence levels, and exchange rate fluctuations. For the PCT system in particular, other important factors include the level of PCT fees as compared to those offered by other filing routes, the attractiveness and value of PCT services as compared to other filing routes, and individual corporate patent strategies.\\n\\nThe Organization manages its investments in accordance with its Policy on Investments, which was also revised during 2015. The policy states that the primary objectives of the Organization’s investment management, in order of importance, shall be (i) preservation of capital; (ii) liquidity and (iii) within the constraints of (i) and (ii), the rate of return. The Organization aims to achieve a market rate of return whenever appropriate and possible for both operating and core cash.\\n\\nOverview of WIPO’s Financial Objectives and Strategies\\n\\nThe financial activities of WIPO are governed by its Financial Regulations, which are approved by the General Assembly. Financial Rules are established by the Director General in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulations. WIPO’s Member States are informed of any modification of the Financial Rules. The Financial Rules govern all the financial management activities of the Organization. Authority and responsibility for the implementation of the Financial Regulations and Rules is delegated by the Director General to the Controller.\\n\\nWIPO’s Risk Management Policy sets out the Organization’s approach to managing risks and internal controls in a consistent and business-oriented manner, in order to support the achievement of its strategic goals and expected results. It is complemented by WIPO’s Risk and Internal Control Management Manual, which covers the day-to-day operational details of risk and internal control management. The policy and the manual, together with the organizational arrangements, the establishment of roles and responsibilities, processes and activities for the management of risks and internal controls represent WIPO’s Risk Management Framework.\\n\\nEvery two years, the Director General presents a Program and Budget to Member States for approval. It details objectives, performance measures and budgetary planning for all proposed activities. The Program and Budget for the 2016/17 biennium was approved by the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO on October 14, 2015. The Program and Budget provides the planning for the biennium within the overall strategic context of the Medium-Term Strategic\\n\\nUnder the guiding principles of WIPO’s Risk Management Policy, risk management is considered an organization-wide responsibility. All staff are responsible for managing risks and the ultimate accountability for risk management lies with the Senior Management Team. Strategic or organizational level risks are identified and reviewed by WIPO’s Risk Management Group, which is chaired by the Director General. Risk management is performed as an integral part of the Organization’s Results-Based Management cycle. The risk management strategy is guided by the risk appetite set by the Member States in WIPO’s Risk Appetite Statement.\\n\\nThe Organization uses a Results-Based Management system to ensure that resources are budgeted and utilized in line with organizational results and priorities. Organizational performance is measured and analyzed on a regular basis through performance indicators, targets and baselines. Under this system, both the Program and Budget and the Medium-Term Strategic Plan form part of WIPO’s planning framework, along with annual work plans and individual staff objectives.\\n\\nThe Organization manages the levels of its reserves in accordance with its Policy on Reserves, which was\\n\\nStatement Highlights\\n\\nThe financial statements prepared in accordance with IPSAS consist of:\\n\\nThe 2016 WIPO financial statements prepared in accordance with IPSAS show a surplus for the year of 32.0 million Swiss francs. The Organization’s net assets increased from 279.1 million Swiss francs in 2015 to 311.3 million Swiss francs as at December 31, 2016.\\n\\n(the difference between total assets and total liabilities) of the Organization. This statement provides information about the financial strength of the Organization, and the resources which are available to support its future objectives;\\n\\nThe 2016 surplus of 32.0 million Swiss francs can be compared to a surplus of 33.3 million Swiss francs in 2015. Total revenue in 2016 was up by 5.8 million Swiss francs on the 2015 figure. Most significantly, revenue from PCT system fees increased by 15.3 million Swiss francs compared to the prior year, although this was partly offset by a decrease of 8.3 million Swiss francs in Madrid system fees revenue. Total expenses rose by 7.0 million Swiss francs compared to 2015. Personnel expenditure increased by 8.1 million Swiss francs in 2016, largely due to the movement in the Organization’s liability for After- Service Health Insurance (ASHI), which is recognized as an expense for the year. The cost of contractual services also rose by 2.3 million Swiss francs compared to 2015, although expenses for travel, training and grants, and supplies and materials, were lower than the prior year (by 1.6 million Swiss francs and 1.5 million Swiss francs respectively).\\n\\nnet surplus or deficit (the difference between total revenue and total expenses) for the year. This statement provides information on the Organization’s sources of revenue, and the cost of its activities. The annual surplus or deficit is presented on a full accrual basis of accounting, recognizing revenue in the period it is earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of when the associated cash is received or paid;\\n\\nStatement of Changes in Net Assets - identifies\\n\\nchange in the net asset position during the year. This statement highlights the sources of changes in the Organization’s overall financial position, including changes due to the surplus or deficit for the period;\\n\\ncash during the year resulting from investing and financing activities. This provides information on how cash has been and used during the year, including borrowing repayment of borrowing, and the acquisition disposal of fixed assets. In contrast to the of Financial Performance, the Organization’s net flow measures the difference between cash into the Organization and cash going out;\\n\\nWIPO’s total assets increased from 977.0 million Swiss francs as at December 31, 2015, to 1,027.2 million Swiss francs as at December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents totaled 529.8 million Swiss francs at the end of 2016 (51.6 per cent of total assets). This represents an increase of 40.3 million Swiss francs compared to the prior year, which was achieved despite the Organization making a further lump sum repayment of 16.0 million Swiss francs in January 2016 against its loan with the Banque Cantonale de Genève and the Banque Cantonale Vaudoise (BCG/BCV). In addition, at the end of 2016 the Organization held 12.5 million Swiss francs of investments, representing funds held in term deposits with a remaining period of more than three months. No such investments were held at the end of 2015. WIPO maintains significant investment in fixed assets, including land, buildings, investment property, intangible assets and equipment with a total net book value of 411.1 million Swiss francs (40.0 per cent of total assets). The land upon which the Organization’s New Building was constructed was revalued during 2016, resulting in an increase of 2.2 million Swiss francs. Although additions of 2.5 million Swiss francs were made to buildings, intangible assets and equipment during 2016, the net book value of fixed assets was reduced by a depreciation and\\n\\nAmounts - presents a comparison of the budget amounts under the Program and Budget, and the actual amounts for the year.

The decision to repay the loan was taken in the context of existing interest rate conditions, including negative interest rates for Swiss franc deposits, and in accordance with the objective of capital preservation, as stipulated in WIPO’s Policy on Investments.\\n\\nThe principal liabilities of the Organization as at December 31, 2016 are payables and advance receipts of 369.3 million Swiss francs (51.6 per cent of total liabilities) and employee benefit liabilities of 188.4 million Swiss francs (26.3 per cent of total liabilities). The largest employee benefit liability for the Organization is the ASHI liability, which totalled 154.3 million Swiss francs at the end of 2016. During 2016 the IPSASB issued a new standard dealing with employee benefits, with an implementation deadline of January 1, 2018. This standard will change the way in which WIPO is able to account for its ASHI liability, and will require previously unrecognized accumulated actuarial losses to be recognized as part of the liability in the statement of financial position. Borrowings totaled 88.7 million Swiss francs at the end of 2016. Following the year end, in January 2017 the Organization took the decision to repay in full the remaining balance of 70.5 million Swiss francs of its\\n\\nThe Organization’s net assets, consisting of its Reserves and Working Capital Funds, totaled 311.3 million Swiss francs at the end of 2016. During the year the Working Capital Funds component of 2.0 million Swiss francs for the PCT Union was returned to the Member States of the PCT Union through deductions from contribution invoices. The increase of 2.2 million Swiss francs in the value of the New Building land was recognized directly in net assets through an increase in the Revaluation Reserve Surplus.§\\n\\nThe Program and Budget result for 2016 prepared on a modified accrual basis (i.e. before the impact of IPSAS adjustments) was a surplus of 62.5 million Swiss francs. The 2016 result for the Organization under IPSAS includes Special Accounts, Projects financed from reserves, and the impact of adjustments related to full accrual accounting in accordance with IPSAS:\\n\\nThe Organization’s results for 2016 showed a surplus for the year of 32.0 million Swiss francs, with total revenue of 387.7 million Swiss francs and total expenses of 355.7 million Swiss francs. This can be compared to a surplus of 33.3 million Swiss francs in 2015, with total revenue of 381.9 million Swiss francs and total expenses of 348.6 million Swiss francs.\\n\\nSummary of financial performance by source of funding\\n\\nThe chart below summarizes the principal differences between the Program and Budget surplus of 62.5 million Swiss francs, and the surplus for the whole Organization prepared on an IPSAS basis of 32.0 million Swiss francs:\\n\\n62.5 +0.5 -4.7 -0.5 -6.3 s c n a r f s -11.4 s i w +2.5 32.0 S f o s -10.6 n o illi m BUDGET Special Projects Revenue Deferral of Depreciation Changes in Capitalization IPSAS RESULT RESULT Accounts financed recognition revenue from and employee of buildings PER from under Special fees amortization benefit additions, FINANCIAL reserves Accounts liabilities equipment, STATEMENTS software Modified Full accrual Entity differences Accounting basis differences accrual basis basis\\n\\nearned, which in the case of international applications is when final publication takes place. For PCT applications, a receivable is also recognized where an application has been filed but no fee has been received by the Organization. The total net impact of these adjustments is a reduction in revenue of 6.3 million Swiss francs. This is principally due to an increase in the balance of deferred revenue from fees (PCT, Madrid and Hague systems), which moved from 219.2 million Swiss francs as at December 31, 2015 to 230.7 million Swiss francs as at December 31, 2016.

The IPSAS adjustments bring the total liabilities recognized in the financial statements into line with the IPSAS compliant calculations of these liabilities, including those prepared by external actuaries. Employee benefit liabilities recognized under IPSAS (ASHI, repatriation grant and travel, accumulated annual leave, home leave, overtime and the Closed Pension Fund) increased by 17.1 million Swiss francs during 2016. Under the Program and Budget, a 6.0 per cent charge is applied to the cost of posts for the funding of after-service employee benefit liabilities. In 2016, this charge generated a balance of 6.5 million Swiss francs, following deductions for after-service employee payments during the period\\n\\nthe ASHI premiums of retirees).

In the IPSAS financial statements, revenue for international filing fees from PCT applications is recognized only on publication of the application. In 2016 there were 210,454 publications compared to 200,928 in 2015.\\n\\nthe following graph shows how annual revenue has moved in line with the number of published applications in the year. Two factors led to higher numbers of publications in 2014 when compared to the trend for the other years presented in the graph. Firstly, in 2014 there were fifty-three weeks of publications, instead of the usual fifty-two. Secondly, there was a surge in PCT applications in March 2014 due to the entering into force one year earlier of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act.\\n\\nWhen looking at revenue from PCT international filing fees as recognized in accordance with IPSAS,\\n\\nPCT - International filing fees and publications 2012-2016\\n\\n230,000 290 280 220,000 R 270 e s v n e o 210,000 n i t 260 u a e c i l b 200,000 250 rf m( a u i n l p f o 190,000 240 )sc noil s r e 230 o b f m 180,000 S w u 220 i N s s 170,000 210 160,000 200 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\\n\\nInternational fees for published applications\\n\\nNations Operational Rates of Exchange (UNORE) at the date of receipt of payment. The exchange gain or loss on fees arises as the difference between the equivalent Swiss franc fee and the actual amount in Swiss francs at the date of payment. In the year 2016, the Organization made a net exchange gain of 5.2 million Swiss francs on PCT fees received (international filing fees and handling fees). This gain concerned principally fees in Japanese yen (gain of 4.4 million Swiss francs in 2016). In 2015, 2014 and 2013, WIPO incurred a net exchange loss on fees received, whereas in 2012 a net gain of 7.5 million Swiss was registered:\\n\\nExchange gains and losses are incurred on PCT international filing fees where these are received in currencies other than the Swiss franc. WIPO establishes equivalent amounts of fees in various currencies for each year according to the exchange rates prevailing on the first Monday of October of the preceding year. Equivalent amounts can be reset during the year if the exchange rate between the other currency and the Swiss franc is changed by 5.0 per cent or more for more than four consecutive Fridays.

Revenue from registrations and renewals (but not including other fees) as recognized in accordance with IPSAS has grown as the number of registrations and renewals have increased year on year. As noted, revenue from Madrid system fees fell by 12.2 per cent in\\n\\n2016 compared to 2015. Madrid system registrations in 2016 fell by 13.9 per cent, totaling 44,728 against 51,938 in 2015. Although Madrid applications in 2016 grew by 7.4 per cent compared to the prior year, there was an increased backlog in registrations linked in part to system issues with the Madrid International Registration Information System:\\n\\nMadrid - basic fees and registrations/renewals 2012-2016\\n\\nl a w e 85,000 R n 55.0 e e v r e d 80,000 n n u a 50.0 e s n 75,000 rf m( o a i n l i t a 70,000 45.0 sc oil r ) n t s i g 65,000 o s e 40.0 f r S f 60,000 w o i s r e 35.0 s b 55,000 m u N 50,000 30.0 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\\n\\nFees for published registrations and renewals\\n\\n9.8 million Swiss francs of voluntary contributions represents revenue received under Special Accounts.

As with PCT and Madrid system fees, revenue from fees related to the processing of applications is recognized when the application has been published. Hague system fees increased by 28.2 per cent compared to 2015. Hague registrations rose from 3,581 in 2015 to 5,233 in 2016. Growth in Hague system activity is linked to the accessions of the Republic of Korea in 2014 and of Japan and the United States of America in 2015. Lisbon system fees totaled 25 thousand Swiss francs in 2016, compared to 17 thousand Swiss francs in 2015.\\n\\nInvestment revenue totalled 21 thousand Swiss francs in 2016. Although investment revenue was 1.5 million Swiss francs in 2015, this figure was almost entirely comprised of a 1.4 million Swiss francs increase in valuation of the Organization’s investment property, the Madrid Union Building. The Organization continues to hold most of its cash balances with the Swiss Federal Finance Administration (AFF), and in February 2015 the AFF introduced zero per cent interest rates to these deposit accounts. This interest rate remained unchanged throughout 2016. Arbitration and mediation revenue of 1.6 million Swiss francs, publications revenue of 0.5 million Swiss francs and other/miscellaneous revenue of 2.8 million Swiss francs for the year 2016 were broadly in line with the prior year.\\n\\nRevenue from assessed contributions of 17.3 million Swiss francs in 2016 represents 4.4 per cent of total revenue, while revenue from voluntary contributions of 10.2 million Swiss francs in 2016 represents 2.6 per cent of total revenue.

The largest expense for the Organization was personnel expenditure of 224.4 million Swiss francs, representing 63.1 per cent of total expenses. Contractual services of 74.4 million Swiss francs were the second largest expense for the Organization, followed by operating expenses of 21.9 million Swiss francs.

Combined these represent 142.5 million Swiss francs, 63.5 per cent of total personnel expenditure for 2016. The next biggest element of personnel expenditure is the Organization’s contributions to the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF), which totaled 26.4 million Swiss francs in 2016. WIPO’s mandated contribution to the UNJSPF is currently 15.8 per cent of a staff member’s pensionable remuneration. After-service employee benefits of 21.6 million Swiss francs represent the cost to the Organization of ASHI, repatriation grant and travel, and accumulated annual leave. The expense for\\n\\n2016 is equivalent to the actual cash payments for these benefits, plus the movement in the amount of the total liability in the year. Allowances of 16.2 million Swiss francs represent 7.2 per cent of total staff expenditure. Allowances include principally education grants for 5.6 million Swiss francs, dependency allowances for 5.0 million Swiss francs and home leave for 1.8 million Swiss francs. The cost of the Organization’s contribution to monthly collective medical insurance premiums for active staff totaled 9.5 million Swiss francs for the year 2016.

The increase in the expense for staff in posts is principally due to the after-service employee benefits cost. This has increased by 6.2 million Swiss francs compared to 2015 following the movement in the ASHI liability between 2015 and 2016. Other staff costs presented separately in the table above represent costs common to both posts and temporary positions (professional accident insurance, Closed Pension Fund costs and litigation costs). Other staff costs have increased by 5.7 million Swiss francs compared to 2015, primarily due to movements in legal provisions related to WIPO personnel.\\n\\nTravel, training and grants total 15.8 million Swiss francs for 2016, and account for 4.4 per cent of total expenses. This represents a decrease of 1.6 million Swiss francs compared to 2015. Both third-party travel (conference participants and lecturers) expense and staff mission costs were lower than in 2015 (by 0.8 million Swiss francs and 0.7 million Swiss francs respectively).\\n\\nContractual services in 2016 total 74.4 million Swiss francs. These expenses have increased by 3.2 per cent compared to the figure of 72.1 million Swiss francs for 2015. Contractual services in the year 2016 concern primarily commercial translation services (25.1 million Swiss francs), IT commercial services (11.7 million Swiss francs), individual contractual services (11.5 million Swiss francs), and International Computing Centre services (11.6 million Swiss francs).\\n\\nThe cost of interns and WIPO fellowships is shown separately in the financial statements. Internships and WIPO fellowships are not included as part of personnel expenditure as they are not covered by WIPO’s Staff Regulations and Rules. WIPO fellowships aim to provide individuals with experience to strengthen their knowledge and\\n\\nOperating expenses in 2016 total 21.9 million Swiss francs, representing an increase of 3.3 per cent compared to the 2015 total of 21.2 million Swiss francs. Operating expenses in 2016 comprise mainly premises and maintenance costs (18.3 million Swiss francs) and communication expenses (2.1 million Swiss francs).\\n\\nAs previously noted, expenses under IPSAS include the depreciation expense of buildings and equipment and the amortization expense of intangible assets, as the cost of these assets is spread over their useful lives. For 2016, depreciation and amortization total 11.4 million Swiss francs, compared to 11.1 million Swiss francs for 2015.\\n\\nExpenses for supplies and materials of 2.0 million Swiss francs have fallen by 42.9 per cent compared to the prior year, mainly due to large software purchases which took place in 2015. Furniture and equipment expenses are also lower, totaling 0.2 million Swiss francs in 2016 compared to 0.8 million Swiss francs in 2015. The decrease is largely due to higher IT equipment purchases in 2015 for the New Conference Hall. Furniture and equipment expenses concern those items which do not meet the Organization’s threshold of 5,000 Swiss francs for capitalization.\\n\\nFinance costs totaled 2.3 million Swiss francs in 2016, compared to 3.1 million Swiss francs in 2015. Finance costs are principally interest repayments on the BCG/BCV loan, totaling 2.1 million Swiss francs in 2016. These interest repayments were 0.8 million Swiss francs lower than the prior year as the loan balance has been reduced by significant lump sum repayments in November 2015 (24.0 million Swiss francs) and January 2016 (16.0 million Swiss francs).\\n\\nhave also been directly impacted by the return of 2.0 million Swiss francs of Working Capital Funds to the Member States of the PCT Union, and an increase of 2.2 million Swiss francs in the Revaluation Reserve Surplus following a revaluation of the New Building land.

An updated valuation of the Organization’s land on which the New Building is constructed was performed during 2016 by an independent expert. This resulted in an increase in the fair value of the land of 2.2 million Swiss francs. The total depreciation and amortization charge against all fixed assets was 11.4 million Swiss francs for 2016.\\n\\nAssets\\n\\nThe Organization has cash, cash equivalents and investment balances of 542.3 million Swiss francs, representing 52.8 per cent of total assets. This includes amounts totaling 161.8 million Swiss francs which are classified as restricted, and amounts totalling 108.6 million Swiss francs which represent strategic cash. The total balance of 542.3 million Swiss francs is 52.8 million Swiss francs higher than the balance of 489.5 million Swiss francs at the end of 2015. The balance of cash and equivalents has increased despite the Organization making a lump sum repayment of 16.0 million in January 2016 against the BCG/BCV New Building loan.\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the fixed assets held by the Organization. Land and property is classified differently under IPSAS depending on the purpose for which it is used, or the nature of the contractual right or agreement under which it is held. Apart from the land and property included below as fixed assets, the Organization leases additional depots and storage facilities in Geneva, and has leases for some of its external offices (see Note 20).

This deferred revenue balance mainly concerns PCT system fees of 228.0 million Swiss francs. Revenue from fees relating to the processing of international applications is deferred until the related application is published. At any given time, a number of PCT applications will have been filed with either receiving offices or WIPO which have yet to be published. As at December 31, 2016, for applications with a 2015 or 2016 filing date, it is estimated that approximately 171,719 applications were unpublished. At the end of the prior year 2015, approximately 155,534 applications filed in 2014 or 2015 were unpublished and the deferred revenue balance for PCT system fees was 217.1 million Swiss francs.\\n\\nFixed assets as at December 31, 2016\\n\\nDecember 31, 2016 Classification in Net Carrying the Financial (in millions Aofm Sowuisnst Statements francs) New Building Site 30.8 Land (Note 10) Buildings and Security Perimeter 8.7 Constructions in Use (Note 10) Buildings and New Conference Hall 65.7 Constructions in Use (Note 10) Buildings and New Building 150.9 Constructions in Use (Note 10) Buildings and A.

The ASHI liability has increased by 17.1 million Swiss francs compared to 2015. The liability is calculated by an independent actuary, and reflects the acquired future cost of WIPO’s share of collective medical insurance premiums for both existing WIPO retirees and the projected number of active WIPO staff who will\\n\\nComposition of employee benefits liabilities as at December 31, 2016\\n\\nDecember 31, Percentage of 2016 Liability (in millions of % Swiss francs) After-Service Health Insurance 154.3 81.9 (ASHI) Repatriation grant and travel 15.4 8.2 Accumulated leave 12.6 6.7 Closed Pension Fund 2.6 1.4 Education grant 2.0 1.1 Accrued overtime 0.5 0.3 Home leave 0.4 0.2 Separation benefits 0.3 0.1 Performance rewards 0.3 0.1 Total employee benefit 188.4 100.0 liabilities\\n\\nOther assets of the Organization totaling 73.8 million Swiss francs include accounts receivable, inventories and advance payments. Within this, the most significant balance is PCT debtors totaling 46.4 million Swiss francs. At any given time, a significant number of PCT applications have been filed with receiving offices and possibly received by WIPO, for which no corresponding fee payment has been received by the Organization. The balance of PCT debtors has increased compared to the prior year, when it totaled 40.9 million Swiss francs. At the end of 2015, approximately 12.8 per cent of applications filed during the preceding twelve months remained unpaid. At the end of 2016, this percentage rose to approximately 15.7 per cent.\\n\\nfor WIPO’s collective medical insurance plan introduced from January 1, 2017. The graph below shows how both the ASHI liability and the unrecognized actuarial losses have developed since 2009, and includes actuarial forecasts for 2017-2020 (applying the same assumptions as for the 2016 calculation). The graph also shows how discount rates and medical cost trend rates have changed since 2009.\\n\\nthe last eight years, and based on actuarial projections is expected to continue to increase in the future. The calculation performed by the independent actuary incorporates a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, medical cost trend rates, staff turnover rates and mortality rates. Changes to these assumptions year on year lead to actuarial gains and losses. Under IPSAS, WIPO currently applies the corridor method to its accounting treatment of these actuarial gains and losses, which means that they are not immediately recognized in the financial statements. In July 2016 the IPSASB issued IPSAS 39, a new standard for employee benefits, with a required implementation date of January 1, 2018. WIPO has not implemented IPSAS 39 in 2016, and is currently analyzing the impacts of this new standard. Under IPSAS 39, the corridor approach for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses is removed, and therefore the implementation of IPSAS 39 would require the recognition of currently unrecognized actuarial losses in the statement of financial position. As at December 31, 2016, WIPO had a total unrecognized cumulative actuarial loss of 166.5 million Swiss francs relating to ASHI, representing an increase of 87.7 million Swiss francs compared to the prior year. This increase in the cumulative actuarial loss was due to movements in the discount rate and medical cost trend rate, and also the impact of higher premiums\\n\\nBorrowings represent the Foundation for Buildings for International Organizations (FIPOI) loan (18.2 million Swiss francs) and the BCG/BCV New Building loan (70.5 million Swiss francs). Total repayments of the principal on these loans were 21.3 million Swiss francs in 2016. In January 2016 the Organization made the second of its scheduled lump sum repayments towards the reimbursement of the BCG/BCV New Building loan, for the amount of 16.0 million Swiss francs. As previously noted, in January 2017, the Organization took the decision to repay in full the remaining balance of 70.5 million Swiss francs of the BCG/BCV loan. The Organization’s other liabilities totaling 69.5 million Swiss francs include 62.5 million Swiss francs of current accounts held on behalf of applicants and contracting parties, and also 7.0 million Swiss francs of provisions for legal costs.\\n\\n5.00 400.0 4.00 300.0 s c n a r f s s iw 3.00 c rep S e f o 200.0 2017 -2020 actuarial forecast tn s n o illim 2.00 100.0 1.00 0.0 0.00 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Liability recognized in statement of financial position Unrecognized actuarial losses Discount rate Medical cost trend rate\\n\\nCash Flow\\n\\nequivalents which are classified as restricted. Restricted cash includes current accounts held for third parties (applicants under the PCT, Madrid and Hague systems, and also certain contracting parties), fees collected on behalf of contracting parties, deposits received in connection with pending procedures related to trademarks, and Special Accounts held on behalf of donors of voluntary contributions. Strategic cash represents the funds held by the Organization which have been allocated for the future financing of after-service employee benefit liabilities, including ASHI. The balance of strategic cash was 108.6 million Swiss francs as at December 31, 2016.\\n\\nThe Organization’s cash, cash equivalents and investments balance as at December 31, 2016 is 542.3 million Swiss francs, compared to 489.5 million Swiss francs as at December 31, 2015. This balance has been increasing since 2011. The increase of 52.8 million Swiss francs between 2015 and 2016 has been achieved despite a lump sum loan repayment of 16.0 million Swiss francs in January 2016.\\n\\nThe Organization generally holds its cash deposits in instant access bank accounts. During 2016 the Organization continued to hold significant balances in notice accounts (with notice periods of up to 35 days) and term deposit accounts (for periods up to 12 months). This has allowed the Organization to avoid incurring charges on certain instant access bank accounts following the introduction of negative interest rates during the previous year.\\n\\nAs already noted, in January 2017, the Organization took the decision to repay in full the remaining balance of 70.5 million Swiss francs of its BCG/BCV loan. The early repayment of the loan balance was made on January 26, 2017, and as a result WIPO incurred a penalty charge of 11.6 million Swiss francs, calculated by reference to the present value of all outstanding interest due on the loan. Following the loan repayment, the Organization’s cash and cash equivalents were therefore reduced by 82.1 million Swiss francs.\\n\\nIn the financial statements cash, cash equivalents and investments are presented separately between restricted, unrestricted and strategic cash balances.

Our responsibilities under those standards are described in the Auditor\\'s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of WIPO in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\\n\\nInformation other than the Financial Statements and Auditor\\'s Report Thereon\\n\\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the included in the annual financial report for the year ended 31 December 2016, but does not include financial statements and our auditor\\'s report thereon.\\n\\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n\\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\\n\\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements\\n\\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IPSAS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\\n\\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing WIPO\\'s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate WIPO or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\n\\nAuditor\\'s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\\n\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\\'s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\n\\nAs part of an audit m accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of WIPO\\'s internal control.  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\\'s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on WIPO\\'s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\\'s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\\'s report. However, future events or conditions may cause WIPO to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

The Conference consists of all Member States whether or not they are members of any of the Unions. The Conference adopts its budget, adopts amendments to the Convention and performs other functions as appropriate.  The Coordination Committee consists of members of the Executive Committees of the Paris or the Berne Unions or both, one\\n\\nfourth of the States party to the WIPO Convention which are not members of any of the Unions, and Switzerland, as the State on whose territory the Organization has its headquarters. The Coordination Committee nominates candidates for Director General, drafts the agenda for the General Assembly, and performs other duties allocated to it under the WIPO Convention.\\n\\nThe World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) was established in 1967, replacing the Bureau for the Protection of Intellectual Property (known by the French acronym for Bureaux Internationaux Réunis pour la Protection de la Propriété Intellectuelle, BIRPI) which had been established in 1893 to administer the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (1883) and the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1886). In 1974, WIPO was recognized as a specialized agency of the United Nations.\\n\\nWIPO’s mission is the promotion of innovation and creativity for the economic, social and cultural development of all countries, through a balanced and effective international intellectual property system. WIPO’s broad-ranging activities are grouped into four main areas of work: providing intellectual property services through the Organization’s Global IP systems; developing and maintaining the technical infrastructure which not only supports the international IP system, but also provides access to its outputs, enhances data flows, and enables global cooperation; serving as a multilateral forum for discussions on the normative development of intellectual property policy; and facilitating the use of IP for social, cultural and economic development, by mainstreaming development considerations and delivering development cooperation activities horizontally across all of the Organization’s programs.\\n\\nWIPO is funded from fees derived from services provided by the Organization, assessed contributions paid by its Member States and voluntary contributions from Member States and other donors. The Organization operates within the framework of a biennial program and budget which provides the appropriations that constitute the budgetary expenditure authorizations approved by the Assemblies for the financial period. The approval of the appropriations provides the authority for the Director General to commit and authorize expenses and to make payments for the purposes assigned within the limits of the appropriations.\\n\\nThe Organization functions in accordance with the WIPO Convention signed in Stockholm on July 14, 1967 and as amended on September 28, 1979. WIPO currently has 189 Member States. WIPO is based in Geneva, Switzerland with external offices in Beijing, Moscow, Rio de Janeiro, Singapore and Tokyo, and a coordination office in New York. The Organization enjoys privileges and immunities as granted under the 1947 Convention on Privileges and Immunities of Specialized Agencies of the United Nations and the 1970 Headquarters Agreement with the Swiss Federal Council, notably being exempt from paying most forms of direct and indirect taxation.\\n\\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n\\nsubstantially ready for their intended use. Borrowing costs relating to the construction of the New Building (interest and fees) and the New Conference Hall (commission on undrawn loan amounts) were capitalized as work in progress during the respective construction phases (see Note 10). Borrowing costs (interest and fees) relating to the acquisition from the World Meteorological Organization of the land rights (droits de superficie) to the site on which the PCT building has been constructed were capitalized as part of the asset value (see Note 9).\\n\\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). The financial statements are presented in Swiss francs, which is the reporting and functional currency of WIPO, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand. The accounting policies have been applied consistently to all years presented.\\n\\nAll other borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the Statement of Financial Performance in the period in which they are incurred.\\n\\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, unless stated otherwise. The statement of cash flow is prepared using the indirect method. The financial statements are prepared on an accrual and going-concern basis.\\n\\nCurrency Transactions\\n\\nThe functional currency of WIPO is the Swiss franc. All transactions occurring in other currencies are translated into Swiss francs using the United Nations Operational Rates of Exchange (UNORE) which represent those prevailing at the date of the transactions. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the reporting date of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than WIPO’s functional currency are recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance.\\n\\nIPSAS Standards 34, 35, 36, 37 and 38 have been applied in 2016, which is prior to their required implementation date of January 1, 2017. These Standards have had no impact on the Organization’s financial statements.\\n\\nIn July 2016 the IPSAS Board issued IPSAS 39 Employee Benefits. This new standard supersedes IPSAS 25, and has a required implementation date of January 1, 2018. WIPO has not implemented IPSAS 39 in 2016, and is currently analyzing the impacts of this new standard. Under IPSAS 39, the corridor approach for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses is removed. WIPO currently applies the corridor approach in relation to its liability for After-Service Health Insurance (ASHI), and therefore the implementation of IPSAS 39 would require the recognition of currently unrecognized actuarial losses (see Note 13).\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nRevenue from exchange transactions comprising the fees charged for applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) system, the Madrid system and the Hague system is recognized at the date of publication. Revenue from fees received for applications not published at the reporting date is deferred until publication has been completed. The portion of the PCT application fee covering the costs of translation of non-English language patentability reports received after publication is also deferred until the translation is completed. All other fees under the PCT, Madrid and Hague systems are recognized when the services covered by the fee have been provided. Revenue from publications is recognized upon full delivery of the good. Revenue from Arbitration and Mediation services is recognized upon delivery of the services related to the submission of a request covered by the fee received.\\n\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\n\\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, deposits held up to 90 days and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.\\n\\nBorrowing Costs\\n\\nGeneral and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are\\n\\nRevenue from non-exchange transactions such as voluntary contributions to Special Accounts supported by enforceable agreements is recognized as revenue at the time the agreement becomes binding unless the agreement includes conditions related to specific\\n\\nperformance or the return of unexpended balances. Such agreements require initial recognition of a liability to defer revenue recognition and then revenue is recognized as the liability is discharged through performance of the specific conditions included in the agreement.\\n\\nshop. A perpetual inventory is maintained of the publications for sale and sample physical counts are undertaken throughout the year to verify inventory balances. At the end of each year items removed from the catalogue of publications for sale or free distribution, along with items for which it is anticipated that there will be no further free distribution or anticipated sales, are taken out of the inventory and their value is written down to zero.\\n\\nAssessed contributions are recognized as revenue at the beginning of each year of the budget period to which the assessment relates.\\n\\nThe cost of paper and other supplies used in the production process has been valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Items held in the retail shop are valued at cost to the Organization, and are marked down to reflect net realizable value if damaged or obsolete. No inventories are pledged as security for liabilities.\\n\\nExpenses are recognized as goods are received and as services are delivered.\\n\\nReceivables\\n\\nReceivables from exchange transactions include fees which are charged to users of WIPO’s intellectual property services through the PCT, Madrid and Hague systems. These are measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable for PCT, Madrid and Hague system fees once the international application has been filed.\\n\\nEquipment\\n\\nEquipment is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Equipment is recognized as an asset if it has a cost of 5,000 Swiss francs or more per unit. Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount of the asset and are included in the Statement of Financial Performance. Heritage assets including donated works of art are not valued in the financial statements.\\n\\nReceivables from non-exchange transactions include uncollected assessed contributions. These are measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable. An allowance for non-recoverable receivables is recorded equal to the assessed contributions frozen by action of the General Assembly plus contributions receivable from Member States that have lost the right to vote in accordance\\n\\nDepreciation is charged so as to write off the full cost of equipment over its estimated useful life using the straight-line method. Where equipment is only in use for part of the year (due to acquisition, disposal or retirement during the year), depreciation is charged only for the months during which the asset was in use. The following ranges of useful lives are applied to the different classes of equipment:\\n\\nInventories\\n\\nInventories include the value of publications held for sale and publications distributed free of charge, the value of supplies and materials utilized in the production of publications and the value of merchandise held in the retail shop. Publications held for sale are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and publications distributed free of charge are valued at cost. The cost of finished publications is determined by using an average cost per printed page (excluding costs of marketing and distribution) multiplied by the number of pages of publications held in the publications inventory. The value of publications that are withdrawn from sale or free distribution is written off during the year in which they become obsolete.\\n\\nClass Estimated useful life Communications and IT 5 years equipment Vehicles 5 years Furniture and furnishings 10 years\\n\\nThe carrying values of equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable.

Subsequent costs of major renovations and improvements to buildings and constructions that increase or extend the future economic benefits or service potential are valued at cost.\\n\\nInvestment property is carried at fair value as determined by an independent valuation in accordance with International Valuation Standards. Changes in fair value are recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance.\\n\\nIntangible Assets\\n\\nIntangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis on all intangible assets of finite life, at rates that will write off the cost or value of the assets over their useful lives. The useful lives of major classes of intangible assets have been estimated as follows:\\n\\nDepreciation is charged so as to write off the full cost of buildings and constructions in use over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Where buildings and constructions are only in use for part of the year (due to acquisition, disposal or retirement during the year), depreciation is charged only for the months during which the asset was in use.

Software or software licenses purchased externally are recognized as an asset if they have a cost of 5,000 Swiss francs or more per unit. Costs that are directly associated with the development of software for use by WIPO are capitalized as intangible assets only if the recognition criteria under IPSAS 31 are met. Direct costs include the software development employee costs. Internally developed software is recognized as an asset if it has a cost of 100,000 Swiss francs or more.\\n\\nThe rights to use property in the Canton of Geneva acquired by the Organization through purchase have been recognized at historic cost and are amortized over the remaining period of the grant. The rights to use property granted by the Canton of Geneva acquired without cost, that revert back to the Canton at the end of the grant, are not valued in the financial statements.\\n\\nLand and Buildings\\n\\nThe carrying values of buildings and constructions are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss, if any. Any impairment loss is recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance.\\n\\nLand is carried at fair value as determined by an independent valuation in accordance with International Valuation Standards. Changes in fair value are recognized directly in net assets through the Revaluation Reserve Surplus. Buildings and constructions in use are valued at the cost of construction when new plus the cost of subsequent improvements, less accumulated depreciation. For the\\n\\nFinancial Instruments\\n\\nobjective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.\\n\\nFinancial Assets\\n\\nFinancial assets within the scope of IPSAS 29 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are classified as financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit, loans and receivables, held-to- maturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. The Organization determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. The Organization\\'s financial assets include cash and short-term deposits, investments,\\n\\nFinancial Liabilities\\n\\nInitial recognition and measurement\\n\\nFinancial liabilities within the scope of IPSAS 29 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit or loans and borrowings, as appropriate. The Organization determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs. The Organization’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables and loans and borrowings.\\n\\nFinancial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through surplus or deficit. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with changes in fair value\\n\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through surplus or deficit. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in surplus or deficit.\\n\\nLoans and receivables\\n\\nLoans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Losses arising from impairment are recognized in surplus or deficit.\\n\\nLoans and borrowings\\n\\nAfter initial recognition, loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognized in surplus or deficit when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the effective interest method amortization process. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.\\n\\nDerecognition\\n\\nThe Organization derecognizes a financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or are waived.\\n\\nDerecognition\\n\\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in surplus or deficit.\\n\\nThe Organization assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is\\n\\nEmployee Benefits\\n\\nSegment Reporting\\n\\nLiabilities are established for After-Service Health Insurance (ASHI) and repatriation grants and travel as determined by an independent actuary on an annual basis utilizing the projected unit credit methodology of valuation. For the ASHI liability actuarial gains and losses are recognized utilizing the corridor approach and amortized over the average years of future service of active staff. In addition, liabilities are established for the value of accumulated leave, home leave not taken, overtime earned but unpaid, separation benefits and performance rewards and for education grants payable at the reporting date that have not been included in current expenditure.\\n\\nSegment reporting is based upon the Unions that form WIPO. Revenue and expenses incurred by the Organization are allocated among the Unions in accordance with an allocation methodology approved by the WIPO Assembly [Program and Budget 2016/17, Annex III]. The methodology allocates revenue and expenses to each program and then to each Union based on a combination of direct revenue and expense, staff head count and each Union’s ability to pay which is itself determined according to a combination of current revenue and reserves. WIPO’s assets and liabilities are not allocated to individual segments, since ownership rests with the Organization as a whole, however, each Union’s share of the Organization’s net assets including Reserves and Working Capital Funds is recognized by segment (see Note 29).\\n\\nWIPO is a member organization participating in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (the UNJSPF or the Fund), which was established by the United Nations General Assembly to provide retirement, death, disability and related benefits to employees. The Fund is a funded, multi-employer defined benefit plan. As specified by Article 3(b) of the Regulations of the Fund, membership in the Fund shall be open to the specialized agencies and to any other international, intergovernmental organization which participates in the common system of salaries, allowances and other conditions of service of the United Nations and the specialized agencies.\\n\\nChanges in Presentation\\n\\nIn the Statement of Financial Position, in order to increase the alignment of terminology with other UN system organizations, “Accounts receivable (non- exchange transactions)” has been renamed “Contributions receivables”, and “Accounts payable” has been renamed “Payables and accruals”.\\n\\nIn the Statement of Financial Performance, the expense category previously called “Travel and fellowships” has been renamed “Travel, training and grants” to better distinguish the nature of this expense from WIPO fellowships. In Note 13 “Accrued overtime” has been renamed “Overtime and credit hours” to more accurately reflect the nature of this liability.\\n\\nThe Fund exposes participating organizations to actuarial risks associated with the current and former employees of other organizations participating in the Fund, with the result that there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the obligation, plan assets, and costs to individual organizations participating in the plan. WIPO and the UNJSPF, in line with the other participating organizations in the Fund, are not in a position to identify WIPO’s proportionate share of the defined benefit obligation, the plan assets and the costs associated with the plan with sufficient reliability for accounting purposes. Hence WIPO has treated this plan as if it were a defined contribution plan in line with the requirements of IPSAS 25. WIPO’s contributions to the Fund during the financial period are recognized as expenses in the statement of financial performance.\\n\\nUse of Estimates\\n\\nThe financial statements necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Estimates include, but are not limited to: ASHI and repatriation grants and travel liabilities (the value of which are calculated by an independent actuary), other employee benefit liabilities, provisions for litigation, valuation of publications inventory, financial risk on accounts receivable, accrued charges and the degree of impairment of fixed assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the period in which they become known.\\n\\nProvisions\\n\\nProvisions are recognized when the Organization has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, whereby it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and where a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.\\n\\nAll balances are presented in thousands of Swiss francs, as a result small rounding differences may occur.\\n\\n12 14 113,617 75,465 6,788 16,603 139,418 146,619 361 - 7,170 - 4,574 18 271,940 238,719 61,802 55,315 717 456 84,874 84,160 - 108 - 223 14,428 21,598 161,821 161,860 88,917 88,917 7,139 - 96,056 88,917 529,817 489,496\\n\\nDeposits with banks - Swiss francs Deposits with banks - other currencies Funds invested with AFF - Swiss francs Term deposits less than\\n\\nmonths - Swiss francs Notice accounts - Swiss francs Notice accounts - other currencies Total unrestricted cash\\n\\nTotal cash and cash equivalents\\n\\nCash deposits are generally held in instant access bank accounts.

Following the implementation of new provisions by the AFF relating to the opening and keeping of deposit accounts, from December 15, 2017 WIPO will no longer be able to hold deposits with them. Until this date WIPO cannot increase the balance of its existing deposits. The interest rate on deposits held with the AFF was 0.00 per cent during 2016.\\n\\nThe Organization holds funds allocated for the future financing of after-service employee benefit liabilities, including ASHI. Under WIPO’s Policy on Investments, these funds are classified as strategic cash.

The allowance covers amounts due from Member States that have lost the right to vote under Article 11, paragraph 5 of the WIPO Convention and contributions from least developed countries which have been frozen by action of the Assemblies. The total of the allowance as at December 31, 2016 is 6.3 million Swiss francs (6.3 million Swiss francs as at December 31, 2015).\\n\\nUPOV expenditure reimbursable represents payments made on behalf of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants by the Organization for which reimbursement has not yet been received.\\n\\nFunds advanced to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) are utilized to make payments on behalf of the Organization.

Maximum grants are established for each country. International staff are eligible to receive an advance equal to the estimated amount of the education grant for each child at the beginning of the scholastic year. Staff advances for education grants represent the total grants advanced for the 2016-2017 scholastic year.\\n\\nThe write-down of finished publications inventories to net realizable value amounted to 35 thousand Swiss francs (27 thousand Swiss francs in 2015).

The building had first been brought into service in 1964. The property is held at fair value based on a valuation at October 1, 2015 carried out by an independent expert holding recognized and relevant professional qualifications with recent experience in property valuation in the Canton of Geneva. Fair value was determined on an investment based valuation, whereby the estimated future income stream from the property is capitalized at an appropriate investment yield. The yield was selected by reference to the perceived quality and duration of the income and the potential for further rental growth, and was cross-referenced by the evidence provided by comparable transactions. The valuation as at October 1, 2015 resulted in an increase in the fair value of the building of 1.4 million Swiss francs. This increase was recognized in 2015 as investment revenue in the Statement of Financial Performance.\\n\\nIn 2016 the income from rental of the building totaled 366 thousand Swiss francs, and the operating expenditures of the building totaled 399 thousand Swiss francs. These expenditures included renovation costs of 237 thousand Swiss francs for four apartments. The Organization is not aware of any restrictions on the realizability or remittance of revenue from the investment property.\\n\\nThe operating expenditures do not include depreciation of the building. At the reporting date there are no contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop investment property nor for the repairs, maintenance or enhancement of the existing property. However, under Swiss building regulations, it is required that work be carried out to renovate the facades of the existing property. This work should be completed by December 31, 2019. An estimation of the future cost of this work of 0.8 million Swiss francs has been incorporated into the latest valuation as at October 1, 2015.\\n\\nThe leasing of apartments, parking and other facilities in the Madrid Union Building is managed by a leasing agent responsible for collecting all rental income and paying for all expenditures incurred in the operation of the building. Leases are generally for periods of five years and are based on the form of lease approved by the Canton of Geneva. All leases are non-cancellable during the period of the lease. The managing agent receives 3.90 per cent of the gross rental income as compensation for its services. The value of non- cancellable leases as at December 31, 2016 is as follows:\\n\\nSoftware Software Intangible Land surface Movement 2015 externally internally assets under Total rights acquired developed development (in thousands of Swiss francs) January 1, 2015 Gross carrying amount 34,290 803 3,258 585 38,936 Accumulated amortization -8,279 -347 -561 - -9,187 Net carrying amount 26,011 456 2,697 585 29,749 Movements in 2015: Additions - 312 - 264 576 Transfers - - 661 -661 - Disposals - - - - - Disposals amortization - - - - - Amortization -440 -166 -738 - -1,344 Total movements in 2015 -440 146 -77 -397 -768 December 31, 2015 Gross carrying amount 34,290 1,115 3,919 188 39,512 Accumulated amortization -8,719 -513 -1,299 - -10,531 Net carrying amount 25,571 602 2,620 188 28,981\\n\\nwith an option exercisable solely by the Organization of an extension for an additional period of 30 years.

Following the transition to IPSAS from January 1, 2010, buildings which were occupied at that date were valued at an amount determined independently by external consultants, which represents the estimated value of the building when new (deemed cost of construction) including the estimated value of renovations and major repairs made since original occupancy less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Buildings which are brought into use after January 1, 2010 are initially valued at cost. All buildings are depreciated according to the straight-line method based upon the useful life of each major component of the building.\\n\\nThree major construction projects have been completed since the implementation of IPSAS in 2010. The New Building was brought to use in 2011 and the New Conference Hall in 2014. In 2015 WIPO completed a major project to upgrade the safety and security standards of its existing buildings, in line with the implementation of the recommendations of the United Nations Security Management System. This project comprised the New Access Centre (included as part of the Árpád Bogsch building), the Security Operations Centre (included as part of the Georg Bodenhausen building I), and the Security Perimeter (held as a standalone construction).\\n\\nThe land upon which the New Building was constructed was acquired by the Organization at a cost of 13.6 million Swiss francs in 1998 and was revalued to fair value based on International Valuation Standards as determined by an independent appraiser at December 31, 2009 at 28.6 million Swiss francs. The net result of the revaluation of 15.0 million Swiss francs is included in the Revaluation Reserve Surplus which forms part of WIPO’s net assets. An updated valuation of the land was performed by an independent appraiser at December 31, 2016. This valuation indicated an increase in the fair value of the land of 2.2 million Swiss francs. Market value was estimated by capitalizing at an appropriate investment yield the future potential income stream from the property.

The agreement provided for the Organization to advance the initial sum of 10.0 million Swiss francs, plus a further sum of 1.0 million Swiss francs representing interest on the initial advance, equaling a total advance of 11.0 million Swiss francs. The balance of the construction cost was covered by a mortgage between FCIG and the Banque Cantonale de Genève (BCG). The Organization also entered into an agreement to lease the building from FCIG.

Although annual leave is a short- term employee benefit, as staff have the right to accumulate unused annual leave and receive payment in lieu thereof on separation from service, a portion of accumulated leave is classified as a non- current liability. In exceptional circumstances, a staff member may be granted advance annual leave up to a maximum of 10 working days.

In accordance with IPSAS the Organization’s ASHI liability is considered as unfunded as no plan assets are held in a legally separate entity or fund, and therefore no plan assets are deducted from the liability as recognized in the statement of financial position. However, it should be noted that the Organization has established separate funds for the future financing of after-service employee benefit liabilities, including ASHI (see Notes 3 and 4). On the basis of an actuarial valuation carried out in December 2016 by an independent office, the Organization’s ASHI liability was estimated as follows at the reporting date:\\n\\nAfter Service Health Insurance (ASHI): The Organization also has a contractual obligation to provide post-employment medical benefits for its staff members in the form of insurance premiums for the collective medical insurance plan. Staff members (and their spouses, dependent children and survivors) retiring from service are eligible for ASHI coverage if they continue to participate in the collective medical insurance plan after separation from service. In accordance with WIPO’s SRR, a share of 65 per cent of the monthly medical insurance premium is paid by the Organization. From January 1, 2017, monthly medical premiums amount to 596 Swiss francs for adults and 265 Swiss francs for children (previously 552 Swiss francs and 246 Swiss francs for adults and children respectively).

In addition, the market value of assets also exceeded the actuarial value of all accrued liabilities as of the valuation date. At the time of this report, the General Assembly has not invoked the provision of Article 26.\\n\\nThe Fund’s Regulations state that the Pension Board shall have an actuarial valuation made of the Fund at least once every three years by the Consulting Actuary. The practice of the Pension Board has been to carry out an actuarial valuation every two years using the Open Group Aggregate Method.

Construction work financed by the FIPOI has been capitalized as part of the cost of the Security Perimeter, and a corresponding amount recognized as deferred revenue. The balance of deferred revenue as at December 31, 2016 was 4.2 million Swiss francs (4.3 million Swiss francs as at December 31, 2015). This revenue is recognized gradually as the Security Perimeter is depreciated over its useful life.\\n\\nFIPOI loan\\n\\nTotal borrowings\\n\\nremaining balance of the loan of 70.5 million Swiss francs, with final repayment taking place on January 26, 2017 (see Note 28: Events After the Reporting Date).\\n\\nThe Organization borrowed funds (50.8 million Swiss francs and 8.4 million Swiss francs approved in 1977 and 1987 respectively) from the FIPOI for the purpose of constructing its headquarters buildings in Geneva, Switzerland. These loans were originally subject to interest payments. However, in 1996 the Swiss Federal Department of External Relations agreed to waive any further payments of interest and the loans currently require the reimbursement of principal only.\\n\\nNOTE 17: PROVISIONS\\n\\nIn February 2008, the Organization entered into a contract with the Banque Cantonale de Genève (BCG) and the Banque Cantonale Vaudoise (BCV) to borrow 114.0 million Swiss francs, plus a possible supplementary amount of 16.0 million Swiss francs, to be used to finance part of the cost of the construction of the New Building, available for use until February 28, 2011. The supplementary amount of 16.0 million Swiss francs was drawn down on January 27, 2011. The interest rate has been fixed at the Swiss franc Swap LIBOR for up to 15 years, plus a margin of between 0.30 per cent to 0.70 per cent dependent on the length of the term as determined by the Organization. Interest payments in 2016 totaled 2.1 million Swiss francs, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.93 per cent during the year. In addition to the payment of interest, the contract provides for an annual repayment of principal equal to 3.0 per cent of the total amount borrowed beginning on February 28, 2012 for the original loan of 114.0 million Swiss francs and the supplementary loan of 16.0 million Swiss francs.\\n\\nThe movement in provisions during 2015 and 2016 is detailed as follows:\\n\\nLegal Costs (in thousands of Swiss francs) Balance as at December 31, 2014 913 Movements in 2015: Additional provisions made 642 Amounts used -250 Unused amounts reversed -488 Balance as at December 31, 2015 817 Movements in 2016: Additional provisions made 6,645 Amounts used -27 Unused amounts reversed -446 Balance as at December 31, 2016 6,989\\n\\nIn November 2015 the Organization made the first of its scheduled lump sum repayments towards the loan for the amount of 24.0 million Swiss francs. A second lump sum repayment for 16.0 million Swiss francs was made in January 2016. In January 2017, the Organization took the decision to repay in full the\\n\\nBalance as at December 31, 2016\\n\\nAs part of its normal activities, the Organization is subject to litigation. Events occurring prior to December 31, 2016 have created certain legal obligations at the reporting date. As it is probable that\\n\\nthese obligations will require future settlement and as the settlement amounts can be reliably estimated, a provision for legal costs has been established. The timing of any future settlements is uncertain at the reporting date. The amount of the provision has been estimated as closely as possible on the basis of information available.\\n\\nalso have cases which have not yet reached the appeal stage (requests for review and workplace related conflicts and grievances). For these cases the amount of any claim is yet to be confirmed, and therefore no provision is recognized. There are no contingent liabilities for possible settlement payments by the Organization arising from these cases at the reporting date.\\n\\nThe International Computing Centre (ICC) was established in January 1971 pursuant to Resolution 2741 (XXV) of the United Nations General Assembly. ICC provides Information Technology and Communications services to Partners and Users in the United Nations System. As a Partner bound by the Mandate of the ICC, WIPO would be proportionately responsible for any third party claim or liability arising from or related to service activities of the ICC as specified in the ICC Mandate. At 31 December 2016, there are no known claims that impact WIPO. Ownership of assets is with ICC until dissolution. Upon dissolution, the division of all assets and liabilities amongst Partner Organizations shall be agreed by the Management Committee by a formula defined at that time.\\n\\nThe Organization provides facilities for applicants under the PCT, Madrid and Hague systems to deposit funds entitled “current accounts” for which the Organization acts as custodian pending the use of the funds to cover fees required to be paid in connection with individual applications and renewals. These funds are held until such time as specific applications are filed. On receipt of the application and authorization, the current account balance is reduced and the funds are considered deposits until the application has been registered.\\n\\nAs at December 31, 2016, the Organization has non- cancellable contracts for the delivery of goods and services for a total value of 1.1 million Swiss francs. WIPO has contractual commitments relating to non- cancellable lease arrangements. These are detailed in Note 20.\\n\\nIn addition, the Organization maintains bank accounts in its name to provide a mechanism for certain contracting parties to transfer funds which these parties have collected on behalf of the Organization. Until such time as the contracting party informs the Organization that funds held in these accounts represent income belonging to the Organization, the balance remaining in the accounts is not recognized as revenue.\\n\\nNOTE 20: LEASES\\n\\nWIPO as Lessee\\n\\nThe Organization leases additional depots and storage facilities in the Geneva area, and space for its external offices in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo (paid with voluntary contributions to a Special Account), and its coordination office in New York. In addition, the Organization leases printing and photocopying equipment. The value of future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases is as follows:\\n\\nNOTE 19: CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\\n\\nSeveral members of WIPO personnel are in dispute with the Organization. Cases before the WIPO Appeal Board (WAB) and the ILO Administrative Tribunal (ILOAT) for which provisions have been made are reflected in Note 17. No provision has been made for certain other cases before the WAB or the ILOAT where legal advice indicates it is not probable that a liability will arise. The estimated value of contingent liabilities for possible payments by the Organization for claims arising from these cases is 105,000 Swiss francs at the reporting date. Personnel\\n\\nWIPO as Lessor\\n\\nThe Organization has entered into a number of agreements whereby it leases space in or on its headquarters buildings to third parties. These leases are all cancellable subject to notification periods specified in the agreements. The total amount of rental income from these arrangements in the reporting period was 0.6 million Swiss francs (0.6 million Swiss francs in 2015). The Organization also leases apartments, parking and other facilities in the Madrid Union Building. The value of non-cancellable leases and rental income for the Madrid Union Building is provided in Note 8.\\n\\nThe Organization has no outstanding leases qualifying as finance leases at the reporting date. The total amount of lease payments for depots, storage facilities and office space recognized as an expense in the reporting period was 1.7 million Swiss francs (1.9 million Swiss francs in 2015).\\n\\nNOTE 21: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\\n\\nRegulations and Rules, and applicable to all staff. In addition, the Director General, Deputy Directors General and Assistant Directors General receive representation allowances. Key management personnel are members of the UNJSPF to which the personnel and the Organization contribute and are also eligible for participation in the collective medical insurance plan. Key management personnel and their aggregate remuneration are detailed in the following table. There were no loans to key management personnel or to their close family members which were not available to other categories of staff. There was no other remuneration or compensation to key management personnel or to their close family members.\\n\\nThe Organization is governed by the WIPO General Assembly composed of representatives of Member States party to the WIPO Convention which are members of any of the Unions. These representatives do not receive remuneration from the Organization. The Organization is managed by a Director General and by Deputy and Assistant Directors General and officers (key management personnel) who are remunerated by the Organization. The aggregate remuneration paid to key management personnel includes salaries, allowances, statutory travel and other entitlements paid in accordance with the Staff\\n\\nRules and Regulations of UPOV, the office of UPOV, consisting of the UPOV Secretary General and staff, exercises its functions in complete independence of the Organization. The Organization is responsible for providing space, personnel administration, financial administration, procurement services and other administrative support to UPOV in accordance with the terms of an agreement between the Organization and UPOV dated November 26, 1982. UPOV reimburses the Organization for the cost of such services in accordance with the terms of said agreement. In 2016 the Organization received 618 thousand Swiss francs from UPOV to cover the cost of these services. In addition, WIPO receives full reimbursement of all funds disbursed on behalf of UPOV.\\n\\nWIPO has no controlled entities and no interests in other entities which would require disclosure under IPSAS 34-38. WIPO is a member of the UNJSPF and certain of its former staff are members of WIPO’s CROMPI. The relationship with these two funds is explained in detail in Note 13.\\n\\nThe Organization has a relationship with the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) whereby the Director General of the Organization serves as Secretary General of UPOV. The Council of UPOV which serves as UPOV’s governing body consists of the representatives of the contracting parties to the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants of December 2, 1961, as revised.

The Accumulated Surpluses of the Organization represent the accumulated net result of operations in 2016 and prior periods after the impact of IPSAS. The Revaluation Reserve Surplus includes the cumulative results of revaluations of the land owned by the Organization on which the New Building has been constructed (see Note 10). The fair value has been determined by an independent valuation. Following the latest revaluation as at December 31, 2016, the fair value of the land was increased by 2.2 million Swiss francs.\\n\\nThe Organization’s total net assets represent the balance of its reserves, which include its Reserves (Accumulated Surpluses, Special Projects Reserve and Revaluation Reserve Surplus) and Working Capital Funds. The Organization manages the level of its reserves in accordance with its Policy on Reserves. In 2015 the policy was revised and adopted by the Fifty-Fifth Series of Meetings of the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO. The target levels of the Organization’s reserves, including Working Capital Funds, are defined at the level of Unions, on the basis of percentages of estimated biennial expenditure for each Union.\\n\\nThe Policy on Reserves requires a clear separation between Working Capital Funds and other elements of the reserves in accounting and reporting terms. The Working Capital Funds are established for providing advance financing of appropriations should there be a temporary liquidity shortfall, and for such other purposes as the Assemblies of Member States and of the Unions shall decide. The Working Capital Funds are financed by contributions and are held in trust by WIPO for the Member States of the respective Unions. Following approval by the Fifty-Fifth Series of Meetings of the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO, the Working Capital Funds component of 2.0 million Swiss francs for the PCT Union has been\\n\\nWIPO’s Policy on Reserves also establishes the principles and approval mechanism for the use of reserves for one-time projects for capital improvements and exceptional circumstances. The Special Projects Reserve contains the appropriations to these projects financed from reserves, less accumulated expenditure. The Special Projects Reserve was created following the revision of WIPO’s Policy on Reserves in 2015. Its balance at the reporting date reflects amounts to be used for projects already approved. The following table details the projects which are financed by reserves, the expenditure during the year and the remaining balance as at December 31, 2016:\\n\\nCumulative Cumulative Remaining Expenditure Adjustments Remaining Total project expenditure to adjustments to balance as at year ended year ended balance as at budget December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2015 2015 (2) 2015 2016 2016 (3) 2016 (in thousands of Swiss francs) Special Projects Security 7,600 -7,640 141 101 - -101 - Maps modernization 13,804 -13,062 - 742 -742 - - Madrid system database 1,200 -1,093 - 107 -24 - 83 ERP project 25,341 -16,256 - 9,085 -1,852 - 7,233 ICT capital investment 5,180 -4,619 - 561 -386 - 175 Security enhancement 700 - - 700 -129 - 571 ECM implementation 2,068 -75 - 1,993 -449 - 1,544 PCT building renovation 6,000 -84 - 5,916 -353 - 5,563 Geneva lake water cooling 750 -263 - 487 - - 487 system AB building basement 960 -5 - 955 -240 - 715 renovation AB building windows 300 -47 - 253 -47 - 206 replacement Safety and fire protection 400 -123 - 277 -68 - 209 64,303 -43,267 141 21,177 -4,290 -101 16,786 Development agenda 7,182 -6,302 - 880 - -880 - New Construction and New Conference Hall New Construction (1) 157,643 -158,764 1,412 291 -93 -198 - New Conference Hall (including architectural and 75,200 -75,627 1,809 1,382 -294 -1,088 - technical project) 232,843 -234,391 3,221 1,673 -387 -1,286 - Total reserve funded 304,328 -283,960 3,362 23,730 -4,677 -2,267 16,786 projects Revenue in year 2016 4\\n\\n(1) The New Construction project was financed by borrowings, see Note 16.

WIPO’s budget and financial accounts are prepared using two different bases. The Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Net Assets and Statement of Cash Flow are prepared on a full accrual basis, whereas the Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts (Statement V) is prepared on a modified accrual basis.\\n\\nThe WIPO Program and Budget is established on a modified accrual basis in accordance with the Financial Regulations and Rules, and is approved by the Assemblies of the Member States. The Program and Budget for the 2016/17 Biennium established a budget for the biennium of expenditure of 707.0 million Swiss francs.\\n\\nFor 2016, the first year of the biennium, the original and final budget estimate for income was 373.3 million Swiss francs, and for expenditure 350.4 million Swiss francs.

WIPO’s budget is adopted by the Assemblies on a biennial basis, however, separate estimates are prepared for each of the two annual periods. Therefore, there are no timing differences to report. Basis differences occur when the approved budget is\\n\\nprepared on a basis other than the full accrual accounting basis. Basis differences include the depreciation of assets, full recognition of provisions and deferral of unearned revenue. Entity differences represent the inclusion in WIPO’s financial accounts of Special Accounts and projects financed from reserves, which are not included in WIPO’s published Program and Budget.

Adjustments are also recognized to capitalize expenses for the acquisition of equipment, additions of buildings and constructions,\\n\\nThe Organization is exposed to certain foreign currency exchange, credit, interest rate and liquidity risks which arise in the normal course of its operations. This note presents information about the Organization’s exposure to each of the above risks and the policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.\\n\\nSet out below, is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Organization’s financial instruments:\\n\\nFair value amount Financial assets (in thousands of Swiss francs) 2016 Receivables 55,754 55,754 Loans 8,428 8,428 Cash and cash equivalents 529,817 529,817 Investments 12,500 12,500 606,499 606,499 2015 Receivables 51,818 51,818 Loans 8,305 8,305 Cash and cash equivalents 489,496 489,496 549,619 549,619 Carrying Fair value amount Financial liabilities (in thousands of Swiss francs) 2016 Borrowings 88,720 88,720 Payables and accruals 10,763 10,763 Transfers payable 84,874 84,874 Current accounts 62,519 62,519 246,876 246,876 2015 Borrowings 109,979 109,979 Payables and accruals 22,102 22,102 Transfers payable 84,160 84,160 Current accounts 55,771 55,771 272,012 272,012 Credit risk\\n\\nThe Organization manages its investments in accordance with its Policy on Investments. In 2015 the policy was revised and adopted by the Fifty-Fifth Series of Meetings of the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO. The revised policy contains two specific investment policies, one covering operating and core cash and a second one covering strategic cash. Operating cash is the cash required by the Organization to meet daily payment requirements and to ensure that an amount equivalent to the target reserves is available in liquid assets. Core cash is the balance of cash remaining once operating and strategic cash have been deducted. Strategic cash is the cash which has been set aside to finance after- service employee benefit liabilities, including ASHI.\\n\\nFair values\\n\\nThe fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:\\n\\nexchange transactions, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments; Long-term loans, receivables and borrowings are evaluated by the Organization based on parameters such as interest rates and risk characteristics. Allowances have been established for receivables from non-exchange transactions which cover amounts due from Member States that have lost the right to vote under Article\\n\\n, paragraph\\n\\nof the WIPO Convention and for contributions from least developed countries which have been frozen by action of the Assemblies. The concessionary loan to FCIG is recognized at amortized cost with values based on cash flows discounted using a discount rate of\\n\\nper cent. USA taxes reimbursable are recognized at amortized cost\\n\\nCredit risk\\n\\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Organization if counterparties to financial instruments fail to meet their contractual obligations, and it arises principally from the Organization’s loans, receivables, and cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk as at December 31, 2016 was as follows:\\n\\nThe Organization’s receivables from non-exchange transactions are almost exclusively from its Member States representing sovereign governments, and therefore risks related to credit are considered minor. An allowance has been established against the asset value of accounts receivable to reflect receivables for which payment is not anticipated in the short-term.\\n\\nMoney market investments, bonds, notes or other obligations and other fixed income products may only be held with institutions with a minimum short-term credit rating of A-2/P-2 or a minimum long-term credit rating of A-/A3.

The Organization has a further exposure to exchange risk in connection with the cost of pensions for staff previously enrolled in the Closed Pension Fund who are now members of the UNJSPF. In addition, the Organization has external offices in Brazil, China, Japan, Russia and Singapore, and a coordination office in the USA, with limited assets in local currency. There are no hedging contracts in place as at the reporting date.\\n\\nCurrency risk\\n\\nThe Organization receives revenue from fees and voluntary contributions in currencies and incurs expenses in currencies other than its functional currency, the Swiss franc, and is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations of currency exchange rates. The mechanism for managing foreign currency exchange risk in relation to PCT international filing fees is discussed in detail in the financial statement discussion and analysis which precedes these financial statements. The Organization is also exposed to exchange risk arising from the currency differences between amounts payable to International Searching Authorities pursuant to the Regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and amounts received by national patent offices for international search fees from applicants for international patents.\\n\\nCurrency exchange rate sensitivity analysis\\n\\nThe currency exchange rate sensitivity analysis is based on reasonable shifts in exchange rates.

The net effect of all exchange gains and losses of 5.6 million Swiss francs gain in 2016 (3.8 million Swiss francs gain in 2015) is recognized within revenue in the Statement of Financial Performance, principally within the line PCT system fees.\\n\\nThe Organization realizes exchange gains and losses on accounts payable and accounts receivable transactions incurred in currencies other than Swiss francs based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction. Exchange gains and losses are realized on international filing fees and handling fees under the PCT where these are received by the Organization in currencies other than Swiss francs, and on payments made to ISAs under the PCT which are valued in the currency of the ISA but collected by WIPO in Swiss francs or by the national receiving\\n\\nNOTE 28: EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING DATE\\n\\nThe WIPO contribution-financed Unions have been consolidated for presentation purposes. These include the Paris, Berne, Locarno, Nice, Vienna and IPC Unions along with the functions covered by the WIPO Convention. The Patent Cooperation Treaty Union, Madrid Union, Hague Union and Lisbon Union are each governed by an Assembly which meets annually to adopt a budget and take such other actions as may be appropriate under the relevant treaties.\\n\\nWIPO’s reporting date is December 31, 2016 and its financial statements were authorized for issue on April 28, 2017.\\n\\nIn January 2017, the Organization took the decision to repay in full the remaining balance of 70.5 million Swiss francs of its BCG/BCV loan which had been used to finance part of the cost of construction of the New Building. The remaining tranches of the loan had been scheduled to mature in 2019 and 2025. The early repayment of the loan balance was made on January 26, 2017, and as a result WIPO incurred a penalty charge of 11.6 million Swiss francs, calculated by reference to the present value of all outstanding interest due on the loan. Following the loan repayment, the Organization’s cash and cash equivalents were therefore reduced by 82.1 million Swiss francs, while current and non- current liabilities were reduced by 3.9 million Swiss francs and 66.6 million Swiss francs respectively. The early repayment penalty is recognized in full in 2017 as a finance cost in the statement of financial performance.\\n\\nWIPO’s assets and liabilities, other than the reserves representing net assets, are owned by or are the responsibility of the entire Organization and not assets or liabilities of individual Unions or segments. The assets and liabilities generally support a wide range of service delivery activities across multiple Unions (segments). The only exception is the investment property in Meyrin which is owned by the Madrid Union. Therefore, individual assets and liabilities will not be reflected in the disclosure of information for individual segments or Unions. Only the net assets or reserves, including the Reserves and Working Capital Funds are shown by individual segment.\\n\\nMost revenue (contributions, fees, publications) is accounted for by Union in WIPO’s accounts. Revenue from interest earnings has been allocated among the Unions based upon total cash reserves and current revenue in 2016. Expenses are accounted for by program and then re-allocated to the various Unions based upon a methodology accepted by the WIPO General Assembly as part of the adoption of WIPO’s 2016/17 Program and Budget.\\n\\nThe decision to repay the loan was taken in accordance with the objective of capital preservation, as stipulated in WIPO’s Policy on Investments. Given existing interest rate conditions, including negative interest rates for Swiss franc deposits, there is a cost avoidance benefit from repaying the loan when compared to investment of the funds in a risk-free Swiss franc asset of comparable tenor. In repaying the loan the Organization also achieved an immediate saving of 0.3 million Swiss francs (calculated by comparing interest which would have been payable over the remaining life of the loan as against the penalty charge paid in 2017).\\n\\nA separate segment has been established for Special Accounts, representing voluntary contributions administered by WIPO on behalf of individual donors to carry out programs related to WIPO’s mandate. Revenue and expenses related to Special Accounts are accounted for separately in the financial accounting system.\\n\\nNOTE 29: SEGMENT REPORTING\\n\\nThe only inter-segment charge represents the costs of program support incurred by the Unions in support of Special Accounts.
