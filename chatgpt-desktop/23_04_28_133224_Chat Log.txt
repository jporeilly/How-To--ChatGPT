what is lazy conversion in Pentaho

[AI Assistant]: 
Lazy conversion in Pentaho refers to the process of delaying the conversion of data types until they are actually needed. This means that data is stored in its original format until it is required for a specific operation or transformation. This approach can improve performance and reduce memory usage, as it avoids unnecessary conversions and processing of data that may not be needed. However, it can also lead to errors if the data is not properly converted when required, or if the original data format is not compatible with the operation being performed.
